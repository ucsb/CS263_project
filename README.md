# CS 263 Final Project, Fall 2021

## Project Description and Goals

For this project we will be surveying and analyzing the ways in which developers write microservices today. We hope to come to an understanding of what frameworks, languages, libraries, and platforms are popular among microservices developers, and gain experience on how these tools work. How do they compare to each other and how easy are they to use from an application developers perspective? Is there a lot of community support and documentation for these tools? What types of applications are best implemented as microservices and what are the pros and cons of developing an application as a microservices? Ultimately we aim to learn more about how applications designed using a microservice architecture are written, and how the technologies involved in microservice implementation perform in terms of ease of use.
