I continued working on writing a microservice in Golang. You can find it here: https://github.com/aprilsanchez/SleepTracker
I spent most of this week researching about how microservices handles database management.

We also met with Fatih twice this week to learn how to deploy our own microservice on Ambience. Later we'll compile our notes
into a "Cookbook" that can be used as a tutorial for working with Ambience.
